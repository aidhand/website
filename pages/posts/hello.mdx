## Welcome, maybe stay?
This is the first blog post - hopefully more to come.

I've decided to focus about content pertaining to what I've been learning or doing at any given point in time, but with a slight bias toward tech. For example, soon we may see some [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) or even [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)-oriented posts, for that's what I've been learning about. Also, I'm using those things (and others) to build this blog and [Aidhan Creative](https://aidhan.au/).

## Future ideas
- Develop this site into a state where I like it 
- Launch my creative "agency" to help others take advantage of the internet
- Perhaps even make a photo gallery and/or storage webapp - just so I can have them sorted, and on hand where-ever
- I even thought a writing webapp would be useful, maybe integrate it into this? APIs!

That's enough rambling
